# Algorithms-in-Python

The folder called gtg includes the algorithm implementations from the following
book: 

* Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by _Michael H. Goldwasser, Michael T. Goodrich, and Roberto Tamassia_

The folder wedgewick includes algorithm implementations in Python based on the 
book by Sedgewick and the online course from MIT. Here is the outline: 

* Fundamentials: linked list, stacks and queues; case study: percolation

* Sorting: selection, inerting, shell, merge, quick, Heap and other. 

* Searching: binary search and Hash tables.

* Trees: binary trees and binary search tress. 

* Graphs: depth first and breadth first search, shortest paths and minimal spanning tress.
